DDKits is an open source development environment and a workflow tool based on Docker. DDKits allows users to build more than one container under the same port using DNS domain control. It integrates those environments with their hosting provider or continuous integration workflows.  
With DDKits you can easily mimic your production environment on a local and it gives you the ability to setup, develop, pull and deploy your sites much faster. Dockerize your dev environments and tools on OSX, Windows and Linux. ​

**Docker requires a 64-bit version of Ubuntu as well as a kernel version equal to or greater than 3.10. The default 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 server meets these requirements.**
